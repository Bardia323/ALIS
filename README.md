# ALIS
üë®‚Äçüè´ Active Learning Intelligent System. Whitepaper for an AI-powered universal education solution. Inspired from VALIS by PKD.
## üí° Idea: 
Low-temperature Transformer models fine-tuned on text-books create interactive shells which are capable of giving factually correct responses.
ALIS would be a non-profit with the aim of giving higher quality education using interactive terminals.

## THE PROBLEM:
Education, in all levels, is not equal for everyone. While some have access to quality teachers and resources, others don't. Even among people with access to education, there are large differences in quality of education received based on student ability and teacher attention.

## THE SOLUTION:
Active/Adaptive Learning Intelligent System (ALIS) is a new AI-based teaching system which can be tailored to the specific needs of students and will work for anyone from kindergarten to post-doctorate level and in any language. 
We are tackling the problem of education in a way that has never been done before. We are using AI to enhance human learning and we are providing a service that is not only easy to use but also **free**.
In 2016, 82 percent of reported [households in the United States had a subscription to the Internet](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/ACS-39.pdf).
This means that we can potentially (but not necessarily) provide AI-assisted education to at least 269 million residents in the United states alone.

ALIS improves education quality by providing a better way of educating people. Currently [there are 234,266,891 learners affected by Covid-19 around the world](https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse), many of whom do not have access to the quality education that we have in North america. So ALIS helps reduce the amount of resources needed to educate children and adults, thus reducing the need for expensive educational resources.
The ALIS AI pods are not only designed to help children learn, but also adults who want to become better at their chosen profession. For example, if a doctor wants to become a better surgeon, he can use his pod to talk with another pod of doctors and ask questions about anatomy and surgery techniques.

## COSTS
Computation costs cover most of the related expenses. Because of the size of our AI models, which correlates directly with their measure of intelligence, we need powerful graphical processing units (GPUs) for inference. These GPUs are already existent in a scalable manner on various cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud platform. On these platforms, inference costs are minimal ($0.001 per hour). However, as the user base grows, so does the cost. However, 1 premium user per 100 free users will be enough to cover such costs.

We aim to decouple our product from these platforms in the future. However, currently they provide a cost effective way of developing our products. So for these purposes we need to create a unique AI-powered data centers which certainly is a better investment than bitcoin.
A single GPU to run a model costs around $6,700 (Nvidia Tesla V100), however, this single GPU can support 20-30 concurrent users. Inference cost is minimal afterwards with respect to usage.

## FREE WORLD EDUCTAION
Our AI pods will have a limited usage in for users. Students will be able to use them for free provided they don‚Äôt go over their usage limits. This is to keep education free for those who need it most but cannot afford it.
Heavier users will pay a monthly premium fee through the app which will allow for continuous development and support for 
If only 1 out of 10000 people in the United States with internet access (26900 people) get a premium subscription to our services with a monthly fee of 99$, our company will have a projected revenue of $31,957,200 a year, which is enough to keep our AIs engine running and provide free education to the entire world.
